# AGENTS.md

This file documents the use of AI agents in the development and maintenance of this project.

## Project Generation

This entire project (code, dataset, documentation) was generated by an AI agent:
- **Agent**: opencode/glm-4.7-free
- **Date**: February 1, 2026
- **Prompt**: See `prompt.md` for the original task description

## Hardware Documentation

Hardware specifications are documented in `HARDWARE.md`, which contains:
- System CPU, RAM, and GPU specifications
- Performance metrics from benchmark runs
- Software environment details

**Note**: `HARDWARE.md` is gitignored to avoid committing hardware-specific information that varies across development environments.

## Development Workflow

When making changes to this project using AI agents:

1. **Run benchmarks** with the current hardware configuration:
   ```bash
   timeout 300 python microqueries.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --gpu-memory-utilization 0.5
   ```

2. **Update HARDWARE.md** with current hardware specs if they differ from previous runs

3. **Update README.md** with new benchmark results, dataset changes, and performance notes

4. **Test changes** locally before committing to ensure compatibility

5. **Validate dataset** format after any modifications:
   ```bash
   python validate.py
   ```

## Benchmark Results History

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for agent-assisted development:
- Add more diverse context types (code snippets, mathematical problems)
- Implement batch query evaluation for better throughput measurement
- Add visualization of performance metrics
- Create comparison benchmarks across multiple model sizes
- Add automated test suite for dataset integrity
